A movement toolkit such as {\bfseries{movetk}} relies on a geometric library. A number of standard open source libraries are available. The most well known among them being (a) {\bfseries{C\+G\+AL}} (b) {\bfseries{Boost.\+Geometry}} (c) {\bfseries{G\+D\+AL}}. However, each of \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Different}} {\bfseries{Interfaces\+:}} these libraries have their own interface for construction of geometric objects (points, lines, segments etc.). \item {\bfseries{Coverage}} {\bfseries{of}} {\bfseries{functionality\+:}} these libraries like C\+G\+AL provide a comprehensive set of geometric algorithms on these geometric types. \item {\bfseries{Dimension}} {\bfseries{Agnostic\+:}} \item {\bfseries{Licensing}} {\bfseries{Agreements\+:}} Each of these geometric libraries have licences that range from open access to restrictive access.\end{DoxyItemize}
Similarly, the choice of the geometry backend also depends on the scope of usage , for example, for basic geometric objects, a library like G\+D\+AL / Boost.\+Geometry should suffice. In constrast, for advanced usage, a library like C\+G\+AL would be better suited.

Therefore, one of the design decisions of movetk is to let the user choose their own geometry backend. This in turn requires designing \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A generic interface for different geometric objects \item \end{DoxyItemize}
