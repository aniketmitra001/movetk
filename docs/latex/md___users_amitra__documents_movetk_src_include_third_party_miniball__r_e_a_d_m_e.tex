\doxysection*{Miniball}

A C++ and Java library to compute the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_sphere}{\texttt{ miniball}} (a.\+k.\+a. {\itshape min-\/circle}, {\itshape min-\/sphere}, {\itshape smallest enclosing sphere}, etc.) of a point set.

The code works for points in arbitrary dimension. It runs very fast in low dimensions and is practically efficient up to dimensions 10,000. The implementation is based on the algorithm from the paper {\itshape \href{http://hbf.github.com/miniball/seb.pdf}{\texttt{ \char`\"{}\+Fast Smallest-\/\+Enclosing-\/\+Ball Computation in High Dimensions\char`\"{}}}} by Kaspar Fischer, Bernd Gärtner, and Martin Kutz \+\_\+(\href{http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.90.5783}{\texttt{ Proc. 11th European Symposium on Algorithms (E\+SA)}}\+\_\+, p. 630-\/641, 2003).

This project is dedicated to Martin Kutz†.

\doxysection*{Speed}

On a 2.\+66 G\+Hz Intel Core i7 Mac\+Book Pro, the code performs as follows\+:



The chart shows the time in seconds (y-\/axis) needed for the computation of the miniball of {\itshape n} random points (x-\/axis) in dimensions {\itshape d} (3, 5, or 10 in this chart).

\doxysection*{Stability}

The code is well-\/tested and its underlying algorithm should be numerically stable. By \char`\"{}numerically stable\char`\"{} we mean that even for points in {\itshape degenerate position} – like all on a line, all on a circle, identical points in the input, etc. – the algorithm will (i) terminate, (ii) be fast, (iii) provide an accurate result.

\doxysection*{Getting started (Java)}

You can either download the latest J\+AR file from T\+O\+DO or use a build system like Maven or Graddle, or S\+BT (for Scala users).

Take a look at method {\ttfamily T\+O\+DO} for a simple example.

\doxysection*{Getting started (C++)}

On Linux or Mac\+OS, the following steps will get you going\+: (Notice that the Boost library that the instructions below download is only used in this example to generate some input points; the library as such does not depend on it.)


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Get the source code}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone https://github.com/hbf/miniball.git}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd miniball/cpp/test}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Compile an example, which generates random points and computes their miniball}
\DoxyCodeLine{g++ -\/I../main example.C -\/o example -\/O3}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Run it on one million points in 3D}
\DoxyCodeLine{./example 1000000 3}

\doxysubsection*{Float or double?}

The C++ code is written using \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C\%2B\%2B\#Templates}{\texttt{ templates}} and allows the number type to be specified as a template argument.

However, please only use {\ttfamily double} as the number type, as is illustrated in the example program \href{https://github.com/hbf/miniball/blob/master/cpp/test/example.C}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily example.\+C}}} (see line {\ttfamily typedef double FT}).

The code will not run correctly if you use {\ttfamily float}.

\doxysection*{License}

The code is available under the \href{http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html}{\texttt{ Apache 2 License}}, which is explained \href{http://www.tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2.0-(apache-2.0)}{\texttt{ here}}.

If you use the code in your project/product, please drop us a note – we are always interested in learning about new applications!
